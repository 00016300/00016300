The page I created is updated version a website of a company Uzum Market located in Uzbekistan. 
Here is a link to the original website: https://uzum.uz/ru
Making this project I used my own experience. Namely didn't watch any youtube tutorials or did not used any website tutorials. 

I updated the login page of the Uzum Market, which looks better in my opinion. Plus, Question-answer page is also a bit different.

Working on this project, I had several problems with responsivnes of the pages and it took me to look for my issues. After 20-25 minutes I found and tackled this issues.

Another thing, I struggled to find a solution for was creating a product cards and styling them in CSS. When I was styling it was getting very messy, and was hard to understand what I was working on...

It was a quite interesting project to work on. I've never made such a website before. In addition, some things learnt in lecturs were really useful. For instance, using @media for respossivnes of pages.
